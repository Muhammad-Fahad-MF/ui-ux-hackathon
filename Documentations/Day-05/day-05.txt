Sorry but I didnt have any records of errors that I solved but the errors includes: sanity GROQ query error, token error, login error, and a sign up in which user can make multiple accounts with only one email, dynamic route id(type error), middleware errors in which middleware was block CSS and other assets. In total, I am a total noob with SKILL ISSUES!!! but I will improve myself and will keep updating this marketplace site until it reach the level of Amazon, Daraz or Foodpanda(system).
